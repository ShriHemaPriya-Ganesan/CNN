The implementation involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. This code is designed to demonstrate basic deep learning concepts, including the use of layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, and Dense, along with dataset loading, model training, evaluation, and analysis of results.
